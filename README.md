ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m a full-stack engineer based out of Nashville, Tennessee.

âœ¨ I have experience with many different types of projects. Many of my projects are written using React library, while some are custom-built like my early projects. With experience in SQL and MongoDG, I like to integrate front and back-end whenever neccesary. I typically deploy on GitHub pages, Heroku, or Firebase. Connect with me and lets build something together!
